## Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to Uncover Trends

### The Kickstarter dataset contains information about Entertainment campaigns that require donations in order to be produced, or to "kickstart". Important data points in the dataset include (but are not limited to): Name (of production), Goal $ amount, Pledged $ amount, Outcome, Percentage funded, Category & subcategory, and Date Created. The main purpose of our analysis is to uncover any trends in the "theater" Category to determine what leads to success/failure in securing funding. Specifically, Louise wants to know the outcomes of these campaigns based off of their funding goals and launch dates. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### In order to compile our analysis based on the launch date, we had to massage the data a bit. We created a pivot based off of the entire dataset and only included the count of the "successful", "failed", and "canceled" outcomes in the pivot. We also grouped all of the outcomes by month so that we could uncover any trends in the launch date. We then filtered on the "theater" category since that was the only category we were interested in. After some additional sorting, we built the below visualization to uncover any trends from the launch date. We can see from our visualization that campaigns launched in May had the most successful outcomes.

### We also analyzed the outcomes based off of the goal amount. In order to do this, we created 12 different groups of goal amounts. We then calculated the number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes by using a COUNTIFS function for each group based off the goal amount, the outcome, and the "plays" subcategory. We calculated the total amount of projects per group by using the SUM function on the first 3 columns, and then calculated the % of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns. We built the below visualization based off of this new table. On the x-axis are the 12 different groups based off of the goal funding amount, and on the y-axis is total %. We have plotted the Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Cancelled. After an initial glance we can see that the lower the goal amount, the higher chance the campaign will succeed.

### One challenge that I encountered occurred while I was analyzing the outcomes based on goal amounts. While using the COUNTIFS function to calculate number of successful outcomes, I mistakenly counted based off the "pledged" amounts rather than the "goal" amounts. This was a mental error that can easily happen to anyone, so it is important to ensure only the relevant columns of data are being taken into consideration. Another challenge that I encountered was on the Outcomes Based on Goal visualization. My first attempts at creating the visual included the Number Successful, Failed, and Cancelled columns. This led to a confusing and unuseful chart. I fixed this by only highlighting the columns I wanted to visualize, and then creating the chart.

## Results

- When looking at the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date data, one can conclude that the best month to launch a campaign is in the month of May. The month of May has the most successful outcomes out of all the months. Additionally, the month of May has the largest spread between successful and failed campaigns. This means that the high success rate is not simply attributed to a higher amount of campaigns in May, but rather there is a higher success rate in May in general. Another conclusion that can be made is that December is the worst month to launch a campaign. December has the lowest amount of successful outcomes, and also the lowest spread between successful and failed outcomes. This means that almost half of the campaigns in December have failed.

- The conclusion from our Outcomes Based on Goals visualization is the following: the lower the goal amount, the higher chance of success. Our first group of goal funding (less than $1,000) had a 76% success rate. Our second group ($1,000 to $4,999) had a 73% success rate. The next group ($5,000 to $9,999) quickly decreases success rate to 55% and continues to decrease over the remaining groups. The only exceptions are the $35,000 to $39,999 group and the $40,000 to $44,999 group who each had a 67% success rate. These are exceptions because the total projects between these two groups is only 9 total projects, while there are 1,047 total projects across all groups. This small sample size does not provide us with strong enough data to conclude these two groups will always be successful.

- One limitation is sample size. As I mentioned in my conclusion on the Outcomes Based on Goals, the sample size for some goal amount groups is quite small. A larger dataset that contains more samples for all groups would provide us with a stronger representation of success rates across the different groups, which would allow us to be more confident in our conclusions. Another limitation is that we do not have all of the donor information. While we do have total amount of backers and average donation, we do not have the actual donation amounts of each backer. Information on the actual donors and their amounts would allow us to perform analysis on their backgrounds and demographics, so that Louise knows which donors to target. 

- Another table I would be interested in looking at is a table based off of average donation amount, as well as average backer count by month. I think this data would allow us to draw conclusions on how many donors we can expect and how much they will donate on average based off of the category of the campaign and the date the campaign was launched.
